## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Free-tier availability is surfaced in the model selector: when a free-tier API key is active, models that are not usable on the free tier are shown as disabled with a warning chip. Reference pricing is always displayed regardless of the active key type.
- Shutdown notice for Nano Banana (gemini-2.5-flash-image, 2026/10/2).
- Multi API key management: default key, free-tier key, and up to five custom titled keys.
- API key switcher in the title bar; the active key is used for generation, and whether pricing or free-tier info is shown for each model follows the active key's type.
- Free-tier toggle for the default API key (off by default; existing data migrates as unchecked).
- Usage notes button in the title bar that opens a dialog with Google AI Studio usage precautions and recommendations.

### Changed

- Updated reference pricing for all models to the latest values (2026/4/17).
- Updated Veo 3.1 Fast pricing: 720p $0.10/sec, 1080p $0.12/sec, 4K $0.30/sec.
